"""
Functionality for reading recently-recorded data in a plan.

This is intended to provide an easy-to-use way to access data and
metadata generated by a run inside a plan, like for saving a small
file locally with some data, for more immediate use, or doing a conditional
inside a plan, based on the previous run's results.

Note that the data recorded and used here is not permanent, nor complete in
most cases (like with area detectors, that save directly to Ibira, and so doesn't
go through Bluesky at all). To access those, the data saved at Ibira should be used instead.

An example on how to use these is provided below:

.. code-block:: python

    from bluesky import RunEngine
    from bluesky.plans import count

    from ophyd.sim import hw

    from sophys.common.plans.annotated_default_plans import DETECTORS_TYPE, MD_TYPE
    from sophys.common.utils.data_access import get_run_data, setup_databroker


    def example_plan(detectors: DETECTORS_TYPE, *, md: MD_TYPE = None):
        md = md or {}
        _md = {**md, "my_other_thing_key": "my_other_thing_value"}

        uid = (yield from count(detectors, num=10, delay=0.1, md=_md))

        try:
            data_from_count = get_run_data(uid, _md)
        except Exception:
            pass
        else:
            # Save the data to a CSV file locally
            data_from_count.primary.read().to_dataframe().to_csv('my_count.csv', index=False)


    if __name__ == "__main__":
        RE = RunEngine({})

        # This may be ommited, and all it will do is not save the csv file at the end.
        setup_databroker(RE)

        rand = hw().rand
        rand.kind = "hinted"     # Specific to the simulated random device
        rand.start_simulation()  # Specific to the simulated random device

        RE(example_plan([rand]))

    Get the result data from the run with the given UID.

    ----------
    run_uid : str

    run_metadata : dict
        The metadata of that run. Usually the final ``md`` dict.

    ------
